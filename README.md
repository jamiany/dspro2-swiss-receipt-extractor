## Short Project Description

We aim to analyze the semantics of receipts and use computer vision to extract the details of the purchased items and their prices, the shop name / address, and the date into a structured output. This output could be used by accounting software or other money related applications.
We donâ€™t only try to reliably extract the data from receipts but we also want to find out if it is feasible to rely on synthetically generated data for model training.

## Data Description

Our goal is to train the model exclusively on synthetically created data. We generate this data with inspiration of real receipts and make them as realistic as possible to achieve good results in the training. This generated data will be labelled automatically.
We will also use real receipts which we will manually label as validation and testing data. Cloud Service Integration We want to use google cloud as our cloud service integration.

## Kanban Tool

We will use GitHub Projects as our Kanban tool.

## Experiment Tracking Tool

We will use Weights & Biases as our experiment tracking tool.
